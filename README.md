This project is an AI-powered image search and generation engine. It allows users to search for images by keyword, retrieving results through an API. The search results display relevant images in a responsive gallery, which adjusts across different screen sizes for both desktop and mobile users. An AI image generator produces images based on user inputs, utilizing advanced algorithms to generate high-quality visuals on demand. The interface includes dynamic loading with a "Show More" button for additional results, creating a smooth and engaging experience for users to explore AI-generated imagery.
